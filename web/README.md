# Web page assets (not Godot resources)

This folder carries files that must ship **beside** the exported `index.html`, not
inside the pck. The whole folder is `.gdignore`d; on a Web export the
`limpid_export` plugin copies `engine/*` into the export directory
(see `addons/limpid_export/web_export_plugin.gd`).

## engine/ — Stockfish for the browser

`stockfish-18-lite-single.js` + `.wasm`: Stockfish 18, "lite" NNUE net,
**single-threaded** WebAssembly build. Runs in a plain Web Worker: no
SharedArrayBuffer, no COOP/COEP headers, works on GitHub Pages and iOS Safari.
The `js` transport in [`stockfish_engine.gd`](../scripts/chess/stockfish_engine.gd)
spawns it via JavaScriptBridge. The `.js` wrapper resolves its `.wasm` by the same
basename, so the two filenames must stay in sync.

- Source: the `stockfish` npm package v18.0.8 (`package/bin/`),
  built from https://github.com/nmrugg/stockfish.js (maintained for Chess.com).
- License: GPL-3.0 (`Copying.txt`, kept beside the binaries and copied into the
  export). Same license as the game; the play page must keep the visible
  "Source & licenses" link, which also covers this engine.
- Updating: grab the new `-lite-single` pair from the npm tarball
  (`https://registry.npmjs.org/stockfish/-/stockfish-<version>.tgz`), keep the
  same-basename rule, and update `JS_ENGINE` in `stockfish_engine.gd` plus this
  note. Re-run the node benchmark (see PWA_PLAN.md phase 1) after an update.
